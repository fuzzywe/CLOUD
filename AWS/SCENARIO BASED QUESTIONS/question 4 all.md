📌 **Your Answer? (A, B, C, or D)**

✅ **Correct!** 🎉 You earned **+5 points!** (Score: **15** ⭐)  

👉 **Explanation:**  
**Amazon CloudWatch** is the best choice for monitoring AWS Lambda functions because it:  
- **Tracks execution time (duration)** – Helps analyze performance bottlenecks.  
- **Logs invocation count** – Useful for debugging and scaling decisions.  
- **Monitors errors and throttling** – Detects issues in real-time.  
- **Provides alarms and metrics** – Can trigger notifications if something goes wrong.  

💡 **Why not the other options?**  
- **AWS X-Ray (B)**: Used for **distributed tracing**, helps understand request flow across multiple services but isn’t the primary choice for basic Lambda monitoring.  
- **AWS Config (C)**: Used for tracking **resource configurations** (e.g., "Was an IAM policy changed?").  
- **AWS CloudTrail (D)**: Used for **logging AWS API calls**, helpful for security auditing but doesn’t provide real-time Lambda metrics.  

---  

🔹 **Question 4:**  
Your company hosts a **multi-tier web application** on AWS. The architecture includes:  
- A **frontend** running on **Amazon EC2**  
- A **backend API** running on **AWS Lambda**  
- A **database** on **Amazon RDS (MySQL)**  

Users report **slow responses** when querying the database. How can you improve **database performance** with minimal code changes?  

A) Enable **Multi-AZ** for RDS  
B) Use **Amazon RDS Read Replicas**  
C) Switch to **Amazon DynamoDB**  
D) Increase the EC2 instance size  

📌 **Your Answer? (A, B, C, or D)**
❌ **Incorrect!** (Score: **15** ⭐)  

👉 **Correct Answer: B) Use Amazon RDS Read Replicas**  

### **Explanation:**  
When users experience **slow database queries**, it usually means the database is under high **read** load. The best way to improve performance **without changing the code** is to **offload read requests** to **Amazon RDS Read Replicas**.  

### **Why is B correct?**  
- **Read Replicas** help distribute read queries across multiple database instances.  
- They reduce the load on the primary database.  
- Great for applications with **high read traffic** (e.g., dashboards, reporting tools).  
- No need to modify database schemas or application logic significantly.  

### **Why not the other options?**  
- **A) Enable Multi-AZ for RDS**:  
  - **Multi-AZ** improves **fault tolerance** (high availability) but does NOT enhance performance.  
  - It keeps a **standby copy** of your database in another Availability Zone for failover.  
  - It does NOT help with read-heavy workloads.  

- **C) Switch to Amazon DynamoDB**:  
  - DynamoDB is a **NoSQL** database, while **RDS MySQL** is a **relational** database.  
  - **Switching would require major changes** in how your application stores and queries data.  

- **D) Increase the EC2 instance size**:  
  - Your **database is in RDS**, not on EC2!  
  - Increasing EC2 size helps **only if the bottleneck was at the application layer**, not the database.  

💡 **Lesson:** When dealing with **slow database queries**, check if your workload is **read-heavy** or **write-heavy**. Use **Read Replicas** for scaling reads, and **Multi-AZ** for high availability.  

---  

🔹 **Question 5:**  
You're setting up an **S3 bucket** to store **log files** for an application. The logs **must be retained for 1 year**, but you want to **minimize storage costs**. Which S3 storage class should you use?

C) S3 Glacier  
D) S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)  

📌 **Your Answer? (A, B, C, or D)**
❌ **Incorrect!** (Score: **15** ⭐)  

👉 **Correct Answer: C) S3 Glacier**  

---

### **Explanation:**  
Since **log files need to be stored for 1 year** but **won't be accessed frequently**, the best cost-saving option is **Amazon S3 Glacier**.  

### **Why is C (S3 Glacier) correct?**  
✅ **Designed for long-term storage** at **ultra-low cost**.  
✅ **Best for archival data** that doesn’t require immediate access.  
✅ **Retrieval is slower**, but perfect for logs that you **only access occasionally** (e.g., compliance audits).  
✅ **80-90% cheaper** than S3 Standard.  

---

### **Why not the other options?**  
- **A) S3 Standard** ❌  
  - Meant for **frequently accessed** data.  
  - More expensive than necessary for log storage.  

- **B) S3 Intelligent-Tiering** ❌  
  - Automatically moves data between hot and cold storage based on usage.  
  - **Not ideal** if you already know the logs will be accessed **rarely**.  

- **D) S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** ❌  
  - Cheaper than **S3 Standard**, but still more expensive than **S3 Glacier** for long-term storage.  
  - Good for **data that is accessed occasionally**, but not ideal for year-long log storage.  

---

💡 **Lesson:**  
When storing **data for long-term retention**, use **S3 Glacier** for the lowest cost. If logs **must be accessed quickly**, then **S3 Standard-IA** is a better choice.  

---

🔹 **Question 6:**

Which launch type should you use?  

A) **EC2 Launch Type**  
B) **Fargate Launch Type**  
C) **On-Premises Kubernetes**  
D) **Lambda with Docker Containers**  

📌 **Your Answer? (A, B, C, or D)**
❌ **Incorrect!** (Score: **15** ⭐)  

👉 **Correct Answer: B) **Fargate Launch Type**  

---

### **Explanation:**  
You need a **fully managed** infrastructure where you don’t have to manage EC2 instances, and your application should **scale automatically**. **AWS Fargate** is the best solution for this.  

### **Why is B (Fargate) correct?**  
✅ **Serverless for containers** – No need to provision or manage EC2 instances.  
✅ **Automatic scaling** – Adjusts resources dynamically based on demand.  
✅ **Simplified deployment** – You only define the container, and AWS manages the rest.  
✅ **Optimized cost** – You pay only for the CPU and memory used by your containerized application.  

---

### **Why not the other options?**  
- **A) EC2 Launch Type** ❌  
  - Requires **managing EC2 instances**, patching, and scaling manually.  
  - Not a fully managed solution.  

- **C) On-Premises Kubernetes** ❌  
  - Kubernetes requires setting up, managing, and scaling infrastructure yourself.  
  - Not a **fully managed AWS solution**.  

- **D) Lambda with Docker Containers** ❌  
  - AWS Lambda supports **Docker**, but it is for **short-lived, event-driven functions**, not full containerized applications.  
  - Lambda has a **15-minute execution limit**, making it unsuitable for long-running applications.  

---

💡 **Lesson:**  
If you want **fully managed containers**, use **AWS Fargate**. If you need **more control over the infrastructure**, use **EC2 launch type** in ECS.  

---

🔹 **Question 7:**

### **3️⃣ Question: Handling Deployment Rollbacks**  
Your company deploys new versions of an application using **AWS CodeDeploy**. After a recent update, users reported **critical bugs**. You need to **automatically roll back** to the previous stable version. **Which feature should you use?**  

A) Blue/Green Deployment  
B) Canary Deployment  
C) Rolling Update  
D) Manual Redeployment  

✅ **Correct Answer: A) Blue/Green Deployment**  

### **📝 Explanation:**  
- **Blue/Green Deployment** keeps **two environments** (Blue = Current version, Green = New version). If issues arise, traffic is **switched back to the Blue environment**.  
- **Canary Deployment (B)** releases the new version **gradually** to users but does not ensure full rollback.  
- **Rolling Update (C)** updates instances **incrementally** but does not allow instant rollback.  
- **Manual Redeployment (D)** is slow and prone to errors.  

📌 **Key Takeaway:** **Blue/Green Deployment** minimizes risk by allowing **instant rollbacks**.

### **4️⃣ Question: Securing Secrets in CI/CD Pipelines**  
Your team needs to store **database credentials** securely in the **CI/CD pipeline** without exposing them in source code. **Which AWS service should you use?**  

A) AWS Secrets Manager  
B) AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store  
C) Environment Variables in AWS Lambda  
D) AWS IAM Roles  

✅ **Correct Answer: A) AWS Secrets Manager**  

### **📝 Explanation:**  
- **AWS Secrets Manager** securely stores **database passwords, API keys, and other secrets** with automatic **rotation**.  
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (B)** can store secrets but **does not support automatic rotation**.  
- **Environment Variables (C)** are not **secure** for sensitive credentials.  
- **IAM Roles (D)** control permissions but **do not store secrets**.  

📌 **Key Takeaway:** **AWS Secrets Manager** protects **sensitive credentials** in CI/CD workflows.

### **5️⃣ Question: Monitoring a CI/CD Pipeline**  
Your team uses **AWS CodePipeline** for CI/CD. How can you get **real-time notifications** for failed builds or deployments?  

A) AWS CloudTrail  
B) Amazon CloudWatch Events  
C) AWS X-Ray  
D) AWS Config  

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Amazon CloudWatch Events**  

### **📝 Explanation:**  
- **Amazon CloudWatch Events** triggers **notifications or automated actions** when a pipeline fails.  
- **AWS CloudTrail (A)** tracks **API activity**, but **not real-time events**.  
- **AWS X-Ray (C)** is for **tracing application performance**, not pipeline monitoring.  
- **AWS Config (D)** tracks **configuration changes**, not CI/CD failures.  

📌 **Key Takeaway:** Use **Amazon CloudWatch Events** to **monitor AWS CodePipeline** failures.
